      <p><u><span style="font-size:11pt;">Trigger Warning: suicide</span></u></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Vehicular suicide poisoning is a form of suicide in which a person dies by carbon monoxide poisoning caused by a running motor&rsquo;s exhaust. Often caused by one putting themselves in a confined space with a car like a garage, or channeling the exhaust into the interior of the car using a tube.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Cars have become a staple example of our globalized world and technological advancement. People go to work, do groceries,&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;&hellip;.every day using their car. It&rsquo;s the small logistical driving pillar of our static society. If you want to get a job, it&rsquo;s a plus to have drivers license. It&rsquo;s a sign of independence, flexibility, stability,&hellip; The car is a means of survival in nomadic neoliberalism.</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">The car is individualist, it&rsquo;s private property, it signifies status as a token of your positioning in the socioeconomic stratification, it conquers nature and the organic. The diversity of the car industry has historically been used to define capitalist industry against communist or socialist industry, with the Soviet Lada being ridiculed in contrast with the feats of Western car engineering.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">In&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">The System of Objects</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">, Jean Baudrillard attempts to stratify objects in a complex system of commodities. He establishes the car as secondary, but ultimately part of, the domestic sphere. He also positions car ownership in a bureaucratic framework, comparing the driver&apos;s license to a passport and having it revoked to being excommunicated; &ldquo;a kind of social castration&rdquo;. The car, according to Baudrillard, fuses&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">&ldquo;human intelligence and animal strength&rdquo;. &nbsp;</span></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">ENTER the &ldquo;realm of intimacy&rdquo;, not only because it is a small, confined, personal space, but because car ownership and usage flirts with the idea of an accident, with the idea of&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">involuntary</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">death</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">. As phrased by Baudrillard:&nbsp;</span><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">&ldquo;[...] the intimacy of the car arises from an accelerated space-time metabolism and, inextricably, from the fact that the car may at any time become the locus of an accident&rdquo;,&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">cars inherently maintain the imaginary of death. He categorizes this imaginary as something intimate for the driver. When you stand on top of a skyscraper, it&rsquo;s also a natural instinct to think of the possibility of jumping off. The car not only frees the user from &ldquo;organic constraints&rdquo; through its ability to reduce distance traveled in a period of time, but also from &ldquo;social constraints&rdquo; by being a purely functional object, in contrast with the domestic space.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</span><strong><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">Interconnectivity; flexibility; money for the world</span></em></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Your car is your baby, your baby bubble, your safe space to listen to some music, a place where your mind is displaced onto machinery and the road. The metal wall is separating you for some time from death, life, Instagram; calling through your car computer fucks this up though. What do you drive? What drives you in life? Money, my career, respect, that&rsquo;s why I drive a BMW M4. It&rsquo;s all part of this status symbol consumer culture driven society we all know too well.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">I have my driver&rsquo;s exam in less than a week, but I&rsquo;m not really ready for it.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">It&rsquo;s super stressy to know if I made the right decision going for my BMW M4, a lot of guys at the office start getting really into Audi s7&rsquo;s.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Mental health has been deteriorating in the 21</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><sup><span style="font-size:0.6em;">st</span></sup></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;century caused by neo-liberal systems. We have moved into a 24/7 society, living second by second, recycling our ideas. &lsquo;</span><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">For Locke, sleep was a regrettable if unavoidable interruption of God&apos;s intended priorities for human beings: to be industrious and rational.&rsquo; (</span></strong><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;">Crary, J. (2013b).&nbsp;</span></strong><strong><em><span style="font-size:12pt;">24/7: Late Capitalism and the Ends of Sleep</span></em></strong><strong><span style="font-size:12pt;">)&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">Through the use of digital infrastructure and our cars, we are killing the planet, but also destroying the concept of time and space in the meantime as Paul Virilio writes in his book &lsquo;speed and politics&rsquo;,;;;;;; our society is accelerating since YOU can be everywhere at any given time. You can be in an airplane to Seoul while having a digital meeting with someone in New York. The car was, of course, one of the first devices to obfuscate the organic conception of space-time.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">You only go on TikTok to relax and what you get is Andrew Tate and other financial/alpha guru&rsquo;s telling you you&rsquo;re not working enough, you need to make more than 100k, take care of your family, all you wanted were some kitten video&rsquo;s and people falling in parkour videos (sadly this is not 2014). These finance influencers, or&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">finfluencers</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">, pander the internalized logic of guilt and personal failure to their followers, offering them a way out, a path to &lsquo;financial freedom&rsquo;. It is not a coincidence that the car has become a central symbol in their grifting. The image of a G63, a Lamborghini, or a Ferrari in relation to content about financial freedom has become ubiquitous on our timelines. The car continues to be a symbol of success, and negatively, the symbol of failure.</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">We often have to combine jobs -,-- the interim office handed her a schedule where she could clean a building until 11, drive quickly to an old lady&rsquo;s house to clean to be on time at 13 to be at another cleaning job. She has to eat in the car, she is stressed in the car, she also works in a restaurant the street next to hers. Thomas works in finance, he parks his Mercedes in the underground parking lot next to his office. He likes to arrive a few minutes earlier, to have some me-time. In between rides, the uber driver checks his crypto holdings as he fantasizes about financial freedom.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">As Fisher described, we are haunted by our lost futures. We were all hoping that owning a car would launch us into a new kind of future, one breaking us free from neo-liberal restrictions. My car reminds me of a lot of values and futures we were promised in the last century. I remember that and I was born in 2002. Car traffic however connects the dots of the neo-liberalist system into a coherent whole. A serviceman can be at your doorstep within 40 minutes if there is something wrong with your car. Futures and societal progression are mashed up into a technological fa&ccedil;ade feeding financial systems. A lot of people write on how technology shapes politics; what is a new iPhone, BMW and your wireless charging dock going to do? The fake progression reality we have found our society in lowers the mental health and motivation of our society.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">As mentioned before, the carbox is our safe space. For a lot of moms and dads, their only alone time is in their car on their way to work. We have grown connected to it, a relationship starts to form. It gives you time to think; haven&rsquo;t you cried in your car? People opt to commit suicide in their car, stuck in a non-place forever. I want to be clear I don&rsquo;t romanticize it in any sort of way. It symbolizes the need we have to take a break and our close relationship to the machinery we are in contact with every day.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">Do you feel safe with your machinery and do you have certain needs? Can it be dangerous to put a lot of responsibility onto your machines?</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">This form of suicide is also portrayed in pop culture on numerous occasions such as the scene in&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">Mad Men&nbsp;</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">where a character attempts to commit suicide as a result of financial and work-related stress, but his car failed to start. The mediatization of suicide, often being swallowed in the spectacular realm of content creating such as in Logan Paul&rsquo;s controversial video. There is also a sincere correlation between portraiture of suicide in media and suicide rates, with people being confronted sometimes pulled over the edge or people copying a high-profile suicide. This is called the Werther-effect, brought to life after the rise of copycat suicides based on the release of Goethe&rsquo;s &ldquo;The Sorrows of Young Werther&rdquo; in 1774. Our relationship towards cars have also been portrayed in various forms, in extreme or sexual forms as well in the movies Crash (1996;David Cronenberg) and Titane (2021;Julia Ducournau). There is a cyborgification of our desires developing within society, while our non-cyborg qualities are capitalized, deteriorating our mental health and leading people towards suicide. Franco &lsquo;Bifo&rsquo; Berardi writes in &lsquo;Heroes: mass murder and suicide&rsquo;:</span></p>
      <p><strong><span style="font-size:11pt;">&ldquo;Herein lies the trap: people are encouraged to consider their linguistic competence as factors of economic competition, and to manage and invest in them as such. Creativity, expressiveness, affection, emotion &ndash; the human soul, in other words &ndash; are considered to be productive factors, and consequently, they are evaluated according to standards of productivity. Exploitation, competition, precariousness, redundancy are not perceived as the effects of a conflictual social relationship, but are internalized as deficiencies of the self, as personal inadequacies.&quot;</span></strong></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">So you&rsquo;re taught that the frustration with the precarious conditions that define your life should be directed inwards, at yourself, not outwards at the system that reproduces these conditions. Your precarity and austerity are results of you not working hard enough, why don&rsquo;t you have a side hustle? Why do you rest when you are constantly told the grind never sleeps? Driving a Honda is only cool when you are a billionaire.</span></p>
      <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OOmsLlZPaxA?si=fbV7esmkhAzl41fq" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">You no longer work&nbsp;</span><em><span style="font-size:11pt;">with</span></em><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;a group of people, you work by yourself in competition with those people, and only the hardest working person will be rewarded, this is the social darwinist logic of neoliberalism. You no longer sell your labor, you sell cellularized pockets of your time to the highest bidder, with no contract and therefore no benefits, meanwhile you&rsquo;re told that these working conditions are &lsquo;flexible&rsquo; and so they must be in your favor. You hate the idea of a 9 to 5 right? The Uber driver exemplifies these conditions, working under the technoframework of the Uber app, and, ironically, working out of their car. Are you tired and want to take a break from driving people? No worries, another driver will take the job, but you&rsquo;ll miss out on the pay, maybe better to keep driving after all.&nbsp;</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">CONCLUSION: You need to GEAR UP, no? You should think about how to bring yourself-------to the next step,,,, if you&rsquo;re too slow: it&rsquo;s game over. People write on how you need to learn things from suicide cases. When someone commits suicide because of a heartbreak, it teaches us something on love; if someone got fired because they made the wrong trade and committed suicide after, it teaches us something on how we need to be alert at all times during work. This system tries to correlate suicide only with direct personal issues/malfunctions.</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">I don&rsquo;t want to seem pessimistic writing about the suicide wave because of late-capitalist structures. The future is not alllllllllllll lost, no? Humans are powerful, even electricity runs through us</span></p>
      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;so we are connected to our infrastructure, our computers, our cars?</span></p>

      <p><span style="font-size:11pt;">-</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;Did you know it is super difficult to run a car company? Elon Musk said so on a podcast, only a handful of car companies haven&rsquo;t gone bankrupt or bought out at least once. He needs to move between some financial tactics and a supreme-like hype to keep up the Tesla stock with critically online investors.</span><span style="font-size:11pt;"><br></span><span style="font-size:11pt;">&nbsp;-</span></p>
